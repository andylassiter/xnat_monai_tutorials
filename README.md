# XNAT MONAI Tutorials
This repository adapts the [MONAI tutorials](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials) for XNAT + Jupyter.

### Requirements
The examples were adapated to run on an XNAT with the JupyterHub plugin installed and XNAT projects have been created for the required datasets.

### List of notebooks and examples
**2d classification**
#### mednist_tutorial
This notebook shows how to easily integrate MONAI features into existing PyTorch programs. It's based on the MedNIST dataset which is very suitable for beginners as a tutorial. This tutorial also makes use of MONAI's in-built occlusion sensitivity functionality.

XNAT must have the MedNIST dataset uploaded.
